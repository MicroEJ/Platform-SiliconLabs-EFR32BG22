EXHIBIT A-GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MAINTENANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES

PREAMBLE

Depending on the license subscribed by you (herein after the LICENSEE as defined below) and the options the LICENSEE has subscribed to in the course of the licensing subscription process or the non-recurring engineering services ordered, the LICENSEE will be provided with various services (as defined below) that will be subject to the terms of this AGREEMENT.
The SERVICES are intended to help the LICENSEE to use the software programs of MicroEJ S.A. which headquarter is 11 rue du Chemin Rouge, 44373 Nantes Cedex 3, FRANCE ("MICROEJ").
The purpose of these General Terms and Conditions Maintenance and Technical Support is to define the LICENSEE's and MICROEJ's rights and obligations concerning access to and use of the SERVICES.
BY SUBSCRIBING TO THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE, SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENT SERVICE AND/OR DEFECT CORRECTION SERVICE, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ THE FOLLOWING "GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR MAINTENANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES" ("AGREEMENT") AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WHICH ARE APPLICABLE TO YOU.

1-  Definitions

• "SERVICE(S)" means one of the services or a number of the services as the context requires which may either be provided by means of inclusion within the software package for the SOFTWARE or by means of a separate subscription either at the time of obtaining the license to the SOFTWARE or at a later date provided by MICROEJ to assist the LICENSEE in the use of MICROEJ's software programs, as are subscribed to by the LICENSEE.
• "SOFTWARE" means the computer software program or the set of computer software programs which have been licensed to the LICENSEE and that will be supported by one or more of the SERVICES subscribed to by the LICENSEE under this AGREEMENT. SOFTWARE may have a different meaning than the definition stated in MicroEJ SDK EULA as it may apply to other pieces of software designed by MicroEJ within the context of a non-recurrent engineering service contract (hereinafter called Custom SOFTWARE).
• "LICENSEE" means you, the licensee of the SOFTWARE who has subscribed to the SERVICE(S) under this AGREEMENT.
• "LICENSE AGREEMENT" means the contract that is provided with the SOFTWARE and that states the way the LICENSEE may use the SOFTWARE.
• "DEFECT CORRECTION" means either a modification or addition that, when made or added to the SOFTWARE, brings the SOFTWARE into material conformity with its or their published specifications, or a procedure or routine ("an application level indication") that, when observed in the regular operation of the SOFTWARE, avoids the practical adverse effect of such non-conformity.
• "DEFECT" means a dysfunction in the SOFTWARE that necessitates a DEFECT CORRECTION as defined above.
• "COMPUTER" means a single user computer or a network server, which has other terminals or screens connected, at one single physical location, on which the SOFTWARE is to be used.
• "UPDATE" means a new release of the SOFTWARE or SOFTWARE component (i) which MICROEJ makes commercially available and (ii) which would normally be designated as a change in the digit(s) in the product version number. An “UPDATE” may consist of minor modifications provided as a DEFECT CORRECTION or an improvement to the existing features of the SOFTWARE or functionality provided under the SOFTWARE Enhancement Service as stated in paragraph 5- .
• “CRITICAL ERROR” means the DEFECT rendering end-products that embed the SOFTWARE unfit for use.


2-  Collaboration between the Parties

 LICENSEE agrees to notify MICROEJ promptly following the discovery of any DEFECT. Furthermore, on discovery of a DEFECT, LICENSEE agrees, if requested by MICROEJ, to submit to MICROEJ a listing of output and any other data that MICROEJ may need in order to observe and/or reproduce the DEFECT and the operating conditions under which the DEFECT occurred or was discovered.
LICENSEE also agrees to provide MICROEJ with all the necessary hardware/software needed by MICROEJ to reproduce the conditions of the DEFECT reported by the LICENSEE in order either to provide technical support or to produce a DEFECT CORRECTION. If LICENSEE cannot, for any reason, provide MICROEJ with all such necessary hardware/software, MICROEJ shall use its best efforts to reproduce the conditions of the DEFECT reported by the LICENSEE as closely as possible, but MICROEJ will not be responsible in the event that such reproduction of conditions is inadequate or insufficient to properly observe and/or reproduce the defect and therefore produce a DEFECT CORRECTION.

3-  TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE

3.1  Principle
 During the term of this AGREEMENT, the LICENSEE shall be provided with technical support and assistance including the following, subject to the terms of this AGREEMENT:
• helpdesk assistance by email (tickets by emails) within availability and response timeframes set out in clause 3.3 below.
• access to MICROEJ's support resources (including but not limited to the MICROEJ websites and FAQ, and documents).
 The advice is intended to answer questions about the use and operation of the SOFTWARE in cases where the Documentation is incomplete or unclear.
 MICROEJ shall use its reasonable endeavors to make use of all appropriate means to perform the TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE specified in this AGREEMENT.
3.2  TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE Exceptions
 The TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE does not cover COMPUTER operating systems, backup and/or restoration of the SOFTWARE and/or associated data, reinstallation of the SOFTWARE on a different or repaired COMPUTER, accounting issues, Internet connection issues, viruses, spyware, networking issues, hardware or support of any other third-party software or device. Whilst MICROEJ will use its reasonable endeavors to assist in the support of these issues which are not covered by the TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE provided for under this AGREEMENT where requested by the LICENSEE, such additional support and maintenance may incur additional charges on a per incident basis.
 The TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE does not include any training or coaching of the LICENSEE'S users of the SOFTWARE. The LICENSEE must ensure that the users of the SOFTWARE have the skills and training necessary to be able to use the SOFTWARE.
3.3  Response Time
 Standard TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE is provided by MICROEJ to the LICENSEE by MICROEJ under this AGREEMENT by email which will be available from Monday to Friday during office working hour local time, excluding public holidays. Local time and public holidays are subject to the relevant location of the MICROEJ Support Center in question which provides the relevant TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE to the LICENSEE. 
 Acknowledgment of a request for support from the LICENSEE shall be given by MICROEJ within four (4) support operating hours following receipt of the LICENSEE’S request for support. 
 Whilst MICROEJ will use its reasonable endeavors to give a substantive technical response to a request for support from the LICENSEE within sixteen (16) support operating hours, no precise substantive technical response time is implied or guaranteed and time shall not be of the essence with respect to this provision.
3.4  Limited Number of requests
Unless otherwise specified in a specific agreement between the LICENSEE and MICROEJ, the Number of requests of the TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE by the LICENSEE shall be limited to six (6) requests by year of subscription.
For the shake of clarity, one request, as specified above, means one on more questions on the same subject linked to a single technical issue.

4-  DEFECT CORRECTION SERVICE

4.1  Principle
 During the term of this AGREEMENT, in the event the SOFTWARE is faulty or does not operate in conformity with the specification provided to the LICENSEE with the SOFTWARE, MICROEJ shall provide the LICENSEE with one of the following fixes:
• a software UPDATE that the LICENSEE will be able to integrate with the SOFTWARE; or
• an application level indication to avoid the faulty operation.
 For the avoidance of doubt, all costs and expenses relating to the application of such a fix provided by MICROEJ shall be borne by the LICENSEE. MICROEJ shall use its reasonable efforts to correct, in a timely manner, DEFECTS reported to MICROEJ in writing by LICENSEE.
4.2  Error classification
 BLOCKER
• Bugs that can cause harm to the device itself, other systems or harm to users. 
• Bugs preventing development or testing work.
EXAMPLE: Device is totally dead. Cannot be started or is "bricked" to be totally unusable. 
 MAJOR
• Major loss of functionality, severe performance problems, very bad response times or error in important functionality
EXAMPLE: Display flickers badly causing very bad impression of the device.
 MINOR
• Minor loss of functionality, misspelled word, or other problem where an easy workaround exists.
EXAMPLE: UI has some subtle layout problem
 TRIVIAL
• Unnoticeable problem despite it does not match the expected result.
EXAMPLE: UI layout is not as expected but acceptable as a result.
4.3  MicroEJ Obligations
     BLOCKER ERRORS
 During the term of this AGREEMENT, MICROEJ shall provide a solution to correct CRITICAL ERROR and to provide LICENSEE with the relevant fix. If no solution can be found, MICROEJ may be held liable in the performance of such an obligation. In that case, MICROEJ liability will never exceed the amount mentioned in the limitation of liability as stated in the relevant SOFTWARE license Agreement.
     NON- CRITICAL ERROR (Major – Minor – Trivial)
 During the term of this AGREEMENT, MICROEJ shall do its best effort to find a solution to correct non-CRITICAL ERROR and to provide LICENSEE with the relevant fix. If no fix can be found, and MICROEJ cannot provide a solution to LICENSEE to prevent the dysfunction, or if the solution leads to reduced performance of the SOFTWARE, or implies a cost that is disproportioned to the fee paid by LICENSEE for the SERVICE or for the license of the SOFTWARE, the non-critical error may not be fixed. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to correct non-CRITICAL DEFECT under this agreement is an obligation of means.
4.4  Tool Chain Maintenance 
During five (5) years following the release date of the SOFTWARE or, if the SERVICES apply to a Custom SOFTWARE, during the term of this AGREEMENT, MICROEJ shall be entitled to maintain the tool-chain that is used by MICROEJ to create the SOFTWARE under operational conditions. In order to do this, MICROEJ will keep all hardware and software under operational condition, at MICROEJ's offices, so that MICROEJ may:
• perform any validation test on any version of any part of the SOFTWARE,
• build the SOFTWARE (with or without modification for software enhancement or DEFECT CORRECTION).
4.5  DEFECT CORRECTION SERVICE Exceptions
 The LICENSEE acknowledges and agrees that MICROEJ cannot guarantee that all DEFECTS will be fixed. In the event that no fix can be found by MICROEJ to correct a DEFECT and that, due to the relevant DEFECT, the SOFTWARE fails in its essential purpose, the LICENSEE'S sole and exclusive remedy shall be the reimbursement by MICROEJ of the relevant license fee and/or the fees for the SERVICES (if separated) relating to the SOFTWARE in question.

5-  SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENT SERVICE

Principle
 During the term of this AGREEMENT, the LICENSEE shall be given the opportunity to be provided with new versions of the SOFTWARE as and when they are released. UPDATES of the SOFTWARE may potentially include DEFECT CORRECTIONS, functional enhancements and/or performance improvements and/or new tools that will assist the LICENSEE in the use of the relevant SOFTWARE or improve such use.
 Such new versions of the SOFTWARE may be provided, at MICROEJ's discretion, through MICROEJ's website, by email, or any appropriate means.
 The LICENSEE shall make inquiries, by consulting MICROEJ email notification or the MICROEJ’s website from time to time, as to the availability of new UPDATES for the SOFTWARE.
5.2  SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENT SERVICE Exceptions
 This SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENT SERVICE does not cover any necessary data conversion, operating system, hardware, additional training, government mandated changes which require software programming changes, pre-printed form layouts or the conversion and/or adaptation of any modifications or reports requested by the LICENSEE.
 MICROEJ will consider and evaluate the development of custom enhancements for the LICENSEE'S specific requirements and will use reasonable endeavors to respond to the LICENSEE'S requests for additional engineering services pertaining to the SOFTWARE, subject to additional charges being incurred as quoted by MICROEJ on a case by case basis. Such custom enhancements will never be covered by this AGREEMENT and will always be subject to additional charges to be agreed.
6-  Intellectual Property
 As stated in the relevant LICENCE AGREEMENT all UPDATES are subject to the LICENCE AGREEMENT for the relevant SOFTWARE that is corrected or enhanced.
 For the avoidance of doubt, MICROEJ owns all intellectual property rights and title in and to the SOFTWARE in its original form as well as in its new version form as modified by a DEFECT CORRECTION, or enhanced by a version evolution under this AGREEMENT.
 MICROEJ hereby grants to the LICENSEE the right to use new versions of the SOFTWARE, and/or software DEFECT CORRECTION programs in accordance with the LICENCE AGREEMENT of the relevant SOFTWARE.
 Subject to paragraph 4.1 , MICROEJ may produce an application level indication as a DEFECT CORRECTION. In the event that such application level indication requires MICROEJ to provide the LICENSEE with software source code that will be embedded in the LICENSEE'S application, MICROEJ will grant the LICENSEE a worldwide, perpetual, royalty free, non-exclusive license to use the source code created or modified by MICROEJ as a DEFECT CORRECTION solely for the purpose intended.

7-  AGREEMENT TERM

 If the LICENSEE has subscribed to a single SERVICE, the term relating thereto shall be specified in the relevant invoice relating to that subscription. If one of the SERVICES is included in a software and services package, the SUPPORT AGREEMENT term will be the period of access to and use of the SOFTWARE in question. For the avoidance of doubt, if LICENSEE wishes to stop any SERVICE before its term, remaining prorated fee are not due by MICROEJ.
 This AGREEMENT will terminate automatically if the LICENSEE breaches any provision of this AGREEMENT, or the SOFTWARE LICENCE AGREEMENT.
 Upon termination of this AGREEMENT for whatever reason, the LICENSEE will have no claim or entitlement to ownership or use of the SOFTWARE, its UPDATES or enhancements and the LICENSEE will not be provided with any further assistance or support by MICROEJ.
 The term of the toolchain maintenance service stated in paragraph 4.4 shall be five (5) years from the release of the relevant SOFTWARE for standard SOFTWARE and the end of the subscription of the Service by LICENSEE for Custom SOFTWARE. The term of such service shall be irreversible and MICROEJ will warn LICENSEE of the term of the toolchain maintenance of the SOFTWARE and the possibility to offer a long-time support service. 

8-  Limitation of Liability

 NOTHING IN THIS CONTRACT SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT THE LIABILITY OF THE LICENSOR, UNDER APPLICABLE COMPULSORY LAW, FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM THE LICENSOR'S NEGLIGENCE.
 MICROEJ’s maximum liability for damages for any cause whatsoever arising out of this SUPPORT AGREEMENT, regardless of the manner in which claimed or the form of action alleged, is limited to the amount(s) paid to MICROEJ by LICENSEE for the relevant support SERVICE. This provision shall apply irrespective of any agreement that the LICENSEE may have with any third party with regards to the use and/or licensing of the SOFTWARE.
 In no event shall MICROEJ be liable to LICENSEE or any other party for loss of profits or for incidental, indirect, special, or consequential damages arising out of any breach of this AGREEMENT, regardless of whether the possibility of such damages has been communicated to MICROEJ and regardless of whether MICROEJ has or gains knowledge of the existence of such damages. The warranties specifically set forth herein shall be in lieu of all expenses, expressed or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for particular use which are excluded.

9-  Miscellaneous

 The AGREEMENT will be interpreted, governed and construed in accordance with the laws of France. Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this AGREEMENT shall be subject to the arbitration clause set out in the LICENCE AGREEMENT.
 In case of a conflict between the provisions of this AGREEMENT and those of the LICENCE AGREEMENT of the associated SOFTWARE, the provisions of the LICENCE AGREEMENT shall prevail.
